## Resubmission 

### 0.0.3

This is a resubmission. Previous comments

- Capitalize H in Haskell
- Provide URL links to lens resources in DESCRIPTION
- Thoroughly add examples to documention

I believe we have addressed all of the above.

### 0.0.2

This is a resubmission (with a name change). Previous version
was called focal, now it is called lenses. To correct the
issues with the previous upload I have:

- Improved the title
- Elaborated on the purpose and use of lenses
- Dramatically improved the README

Additionally one spellchecker NOTE is spuriously highlighting technical
terms, please disregard.
